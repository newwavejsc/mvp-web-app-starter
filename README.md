## Overview

An MVP web application is designed to validate ideas quickly while maintaining a scalable foundation for future growth.

This repository outlines a generic approach to structuring MVP web projects, helping teams move fast without sacrificing maintainability.

---

## Project Structure

A typical MVP web application includes:

- Frontend application layer
- Backend API services
- Database and data models
- Authentication and authorization
- Deployment and environment configuration

The exact implementation may vary depending on product requirements.

---

## Development Principles

Key principles when building MVP web applications:

- Simplicity over complexity
- Modular and reusable components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Rapid iteration and feedback loops

These principles help reduce risk and development time.

---

## Scalability Considerations

Even at MVP stage, systems should consider:

- Stateless backend services
- Environment-based configuration
- Clear API contracts
- Upgrade paths for future scaling

---

## Notes
